# ðŸ›’ Filterable Product Table (React.js)

A simple and **fully responsive** product table built using **React.js**. This project allows users to filter products by name and stock availability. It is inspired by the [React Docs](https://react.dev/) and helped me understand UI structuring and component-based development.
